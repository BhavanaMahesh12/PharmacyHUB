The Multi-Language Pharmacy Management System (MPMS) is a dynamic, web-based solution developed using PHP and MySQL, aimed at optimizing pharmacy operations globally.

I have designed this Web application using basics of HTML,Javascript, PHP and Mysql. I believe in getting my foundations correct and accurate without needing to dive into the complexities of other languages.
